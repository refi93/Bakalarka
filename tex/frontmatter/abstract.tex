\chapter{Abstract}
The topic of this bachelor thesis is to analyze the deterministic and non deterministic state complexity of regular languages, focusing on the automata over binary alphabet. An important part of this thesis are the chapters 4 and 5, where we present our results. Also the attached program, through which we computed the results. \\ \\
\textbf{\textsc{Keywords:}} finite automata, minimal NFA, minimal DFA, state complexity, enumeration of regular languages
